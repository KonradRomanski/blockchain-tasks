# Introduction - lab01

This code consists of three Python modules, Lab01.py, Transaction.py, and Blockchain.py. The main() function in Lab01.py uses objects from the other two modules to demonstrate the functionality of some of their methods.

## Lab01.py

The Lab01.py module defines a Lab01 class that contains methods for performing two cryptographic tasks: Caesar Cipher encryption and SHA256 hashing.

In the main() function of this module, a Transaction object is created for each row in a given table, and these transactions are added to a Blockchain object. The Lab01 methods are then used to encrypt a string and generate a hash from another string.

## Transaction.py

The Transaction.py module defines a Transaction class that represents a transaction in a blockchain. Each transaction has a unique identifier, sender address, recipient address, and amount. The class also has a __str__() method that formats a string representation of the transaction, and a __repr__() method that returns a string representation of the transaction that can be used to create a new Transaction object.

## Blockchain.py

The Blockchain.py module defines two classes, Block and Blockchain. The Block class represents a block in a blockchain, and the Blockchain class represents the entire blockchain.

Each Block object has a list of Transaction objects, a hash of the previous block, a nonce, a difficulty level, and a hash value that is generated by combining the transactions, previous hash, and nonce. The mine_block() method is used to generate a hash for the block by incrementing the nonce until the hash value has a specified number of zeros at the beginning, which ensures that the block is valid.

The Blockchain class has a list of Block objects, and a difficulty level that determines the number of zeros required at the beginning of each block's hash. The add_transaction() method is used to add a new transaction to the blockchain by appending it to the current block if there is space, or creating a new block if the current block is full. The print_blockchain() and print_blockchain_detailed() methods are used to display the contents of the blockchain.

# Conclusion

This code demonstrates the basic functionality of a blockchain, including creating and adding transactions, and mining blocks. The Lab01 class provides useful methods for performing cryptographic tasks, and the Transaction and Block classes provide representations for transactions and blocks in a blockchain. The Blockchain class ties everything together by managing the chain of blocks and ensuring its integrity.

# Usage

To use the Transaction, Block, and Blockchain classes in the main() function, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a list of lists, where each inner list represents a transaction with four elements: transaction_id, sender, recipient, and amount.
2. Create a list of Transaction objects by iterating over the list of lists and passing each inner list as arguments to the Transaction constructor.
3. Create an instance of the Lab01 class.
4. Call the caesar_encrypt() method of the Lab01 instance and pass a string as an argument to encrypt it using Caesar Cipher.
5. Call the sha256_hash() method of the Lab01 instance and pass a string as an argument to generate its SHA256 hash.
6. Create an instance of the Blockchain class by passing a difficulty value to its constructor.
7. Iterate over the list of Transaction objects and add each transaction to the blockchain using the add_transaction() method of the Blockchain instance.
8. Print the blockchain using either the print_blockchain() or print_blockchain_detailed() method of the Blockchain instance.

Here's an example of how you can use the classes in main():


```
from lab01 import Lab01
from Transaction import Transaction
from Blockchain import Blockchain


def main():
    # Create a list of transaction data
    table = [
        [1, 'A', 'N', 3],
        [2, 'M', 'O', 5],
        [3, 'O', 'K', 4],
        [4, 'R', 'J', 1],
        [5, 'Y', 'A', 0],
        [6, 'Z', 'L', 0],
        [7, 'I', 'O', 1],
        [8, 'N', 'K', 4],
        [9, 'O', 'I', 4],
        [10, 'P', 'M', 1]
    ]
    # Create a list of Transaction objects
    transactions = [Transaction(*row) for row in table]

    # Create an instance of the Lab01 class
    lab01 = Lab01()

    # Encrypt a string using Caesar Cipher
    string = "4RJ1"
    print("String:", string)
    print("Task2 - Caesar Cipher")
    print(lab01.caesar_encrypt(string, 5))

    # Generate a SHA256 hash of a string
    print("Task3 - SHA256 Hash")
    print(lab01.sha256_hash(string))
    print()

    # Add transactions to the blockchain
    difficulty = 4
    blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty)
    for transaction in transactions:
        print("Adding transaction:", transaction)
        blockchain.add_transaction(transaction)
    blockchain.print_blockchain_detailed()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this example, the main() function does the following:

1. Creates a list of transaction data called table.
2. Creates a list of Transaction objects by iterating over table and passing each inner list as arguments to the Transaction constructor.
3. Creates an instance of the Lab01 class.
4. Calls the caesar_encrypt() method of the Lab01 instance and passes a string to encrypt it using Caesar Cipher.
5. Calls the sha256_hash() method of the Lab01 instance and passes a string to generate its SHA256 hash.
6. Creates an instance of the Blockchain class by passing a difficulty value to its constructor.
7. Iterates over the list of `Transaction
